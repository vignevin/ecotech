Welcome to the Precision spraying and Biospraytech demo !

UMT ECOTECH aims at developping precision spraying for optimising application of products : quantity, way to target the crop, coverage and water volumes. Biospraytech is our program to use **precision spraying** for assessing the most appropriate methods and sprayers settings to spray **biocontrol** and obtain protection programs that meet the **Green Deal** objectives.

The prototype prepared by Berthoud and Optima to support this program can control each individual nozzle with a centrimetric precision on the vertical boom according to requirements provided in a map.

Vegetation maps such as made from mobile 2D Lidar measurements can also be used in the process.
