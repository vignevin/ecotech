Biospraytech is our program to use precision spraying for assessing the most appropriate methods and sprayers settings to spray biocontrol and obtain protection programs that meet the Green Deal objectives.\nThe prototype prepared by Berthoud and Optima to support this program can control each individual nozzle with a centrimetric precision on the vertical boom according to requirements provided in a map.\nVegetation maps such as made from mobile 2D Lidar measurements can also be used in the process."
