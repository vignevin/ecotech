In 2023, we made a field trial on a 2h commercial vineyard to explore how the spray pattern and the dosage of PPP affects the control of Powdery Mildew.

In this experiment, 2 factors were tested :

-   the **dose of phytosanitary products** : from 0.7 to 2x the reference dose (1N)

-   the **spray pattern** :

10 experimental treatments with around 20 replicates each @tbl-treatments : **207 experimental units** were implemented on the field thanks to the **prototype PWM sprayer**.
