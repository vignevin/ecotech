The modulation map is created from the experimental design map, where each experimental unit is a section of a grapevine row with a specific spray pattern and a specific PPP dose. The modulation map defines geographic polygons with volume rate instruction for each nozzle of the sprayer.

The nozzle volume rate instructions in each polygon depend on the sprayer direction.
